OpenStack Operator Tooling
==========================

This repo is to help get shared Operators tools, experiences, and workflows in
one location. These tools are not fully tested and are community supported. The
goal is to create somewhere that useful scripts and other tools can be shared,
improved, and used as a starting point to customize for your own specific
deployment.

For more details on how to contribute, please follow the Gerrit git-review
process described at
https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/code-and-documentation/quick-start.html.

If you need some additional help or have questions getting your patches pushed,
please reach out to anyone in the First Contact SIG! https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/First_Contact_SIG

This repo is maintained by the OpenStack Operation Docs and Tooling  Special
Interest Group (SIG). All work is voluntary by members of the community, and
help is always welcomed. Some more information about the goals of this project
can be found on the OSOps wiki page:

History
-------

This repo is an attempt to pull together tools from several different repos
that were created with similar goals over the years. As such, some of the
structure and some of the message in the commit history may seem a bit odd.

We would like to make access to these tools as easy as possible. If you have a
good idea for how to restructure the code, please feel free to propose changes!
